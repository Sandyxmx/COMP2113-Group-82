In Monster Arena, you will encounter one monster each level
Upon defeating the monster, you can choose one out of the three
attributes to upgrade, namely Strength, Agility, and Defense. The fighting
works pretty much like rock, paper, scissors where you choose to use
one of the three atributes, and so does the monster.
- If your move counters the monster's move, your coredponding attribute
is strengthened by 50% for the round.
- If you picked the same move as the monster, your coredponding attribute
remains unchanged.
- If your move is countered by the monster's move, your coredponding attribute
is weakened by 50% for the round.
Counter Relations: Strength > Agility > Defense > Strength
Eventually, you win if the attribute you picked exceeds that of the monster,
tie if you and the monster have the same corresponding attributes
you lose if you are exceeded by the monster.
You have 3 lives which is deducted by one everytime you lose, and so does the monster.
Whoever reaches 0 first loses. Your life is restored after each fight.
Try to beat as many monsters as possible.
